Antora is designed to help you write and publish your documentation.
However, we can't fully realize this goal without your feedback!
We encourage you to report issues, ask questions, share ideas, or discuss other aspects of this project using the communication tools provided below.

== Chat

If you want to ask for help, share feedback, or exchange ideas with fellow community members in real time, please join the project chat.
The project chat is the preferred means of communication for all Antora users.

If you find an ongoing discussion that matches the topic of your post, feel free to join that discussion.
Otherwise, please post a new topic in the `#users` stream.
Only post to a different stream if you understand the stream's purpose and have determined that your topic is suitable for it.

The discussions in the project chat are archived, but there's no guarantee those logs will be saved indefinitely.
Keep in mind that users participate in the project chat voluntarily, so please respect their time.
