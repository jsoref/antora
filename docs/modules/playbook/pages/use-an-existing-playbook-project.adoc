= Use an Existing Playbook Project

*This page is for people joining a documentation project that already uses Antora.*

include::partial$playbook-project-summary.adoc[]

Before you can generate a site with Antora, you'll need to fetch the playbook project for your site.

== Fetch the playbook project

To start, open a terminal and clone the playbook project using git:

[source,subs=attributes+]
$ git clone your-playbook-repo && cd "`basename $_`"

// Good place to put in demo info

The command clones an existing playbook project and then switches to the project folder.

== What's next?

* xref:ROOT:run-antora.adoc[Run Antora] to generate the site.
* Modify the playbook to xref:playbook-schema.adoc[configure the site properties, inputs, and outputs].
