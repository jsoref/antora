== Add an image to a page

To insert a standalone image, use the AsciiDoc block image macro (`image::[]`).

Let's break this down.
You start with the image macro prefix, `image::` or `+image:+`.
Next is the target.
Put the path of the image relative to the xref:ROOT:modules.adoc#images-dir[image catalog] in that slot (no need for an attribute prefix).
Finally, end with a pair of square brackets (`+[]+`), optionally containing alt text for the image (which is otherwise generated).

A module's image files should be saved in its xref:ROOT:modules.adoc#images-dir[images folder].
