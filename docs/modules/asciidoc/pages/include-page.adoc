You can insert one page, or a portion of that page, into another page using the include directive.

== The page-partial attribute

Before we get started, we need to talk about the `page-partial` attribute.
If you plan to use a page as an include, you *must* define the `page-partial` attribute in the header of that page, as shown here:

[source]
----
= Page Used as an Include
:page-partial:

Page contents.
----

This attribute declaration tells Antora to keep the source lines available so they can be used in an include.

== Include directive structure for pages

You can include a page (or a portion of that page) into another page using either a relative path (a path relative to the current file) or the familiar resource ID syntax in the target of the include directive.

----
\include::./relative-path.adoc[<attrlist>]
----

or

----
\include::version@component:module:page$relative-path.adoc[<attrlist>]
----

Let's explore this syntax.

. On a new line, enter the name of the directive followed by two colons.
+
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
**include::**version@component:module:page$relative-path.adoc[]
----

. Next, enter the relative path (starting with `./`) or the xref:page:page-id.adoc[resource ID] of the target file.
+
--
A relative path must begin with `./`.

[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
\include::**./relative-path.adoc**[]
----

A page's resource ID is determined just like the xref:page-to-page-xref.adoc#same-module[coordinates in an xref].
However, when used in an include directive, the resource ID must contain the `page$` family (since it supports multiple families).
All other segments (component, version, and module) are optional and will inherit the context from the current file.

[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
\include::**version@component:module:page$relative-path.adoc**[]
----
--

. Close the directive with a set of square brackets (`[]`).
The brackets may contain an optional list of attributes (i.e., attrlist) such as `leveloffset`, `tag`, and `tags`.
The attributes should be entered as key=value pairs separated by commas.
+
[listing,subs=+quotes]
----
include::version@component:module:page$relative-path.adoc**[tag=definition]**
----

Currently, Antora only supports filtering lines of an include by tags, not by lines.
