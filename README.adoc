{uri-project}[Antora] is a modular, multi-repository site generator designed for creating documentation sites from content composed in AsciiDoc and processed with {uri-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor].

Antora's toolchain and workflow help documentation and engineering teams create, manage, collaborate on, remix, and publish documentation sites sourced from multiple versioned git repositories without needing expertise in web technologies, build automation, or system administration.

This project includes a command line interface (CLI) and a preassembled site generator pipeline so you can quickly start publishing documentation sites with Antora.

== Quickstart

This section offers a basic tutorial for evaluating Antora.
More comprehensive installation instructions are in the {uri-docs}[Antora documentation].

=== Prerequisites

Antora is built on Node.js ("`Node`") and is verified to work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

To install Antora, you'll need Node (including npm, which is bundled with Node) on your system.
You may also find the base build tools for your OS helpful (which includes `git`), though they're not required.

==== Node

You need Node installed on your machine to install and run Antora.

Antora follows {uri-node-releases}[Node's release schedule], so we advise that you choose an active long-term support (LTS) release of Node.
We recommend using Node 10.
While you can use other versions of Node, Antora is only tested against active LTS releases.

To check whether you have Node installed, and which version, open a terminal and type:

 $ node --version

If this command fails with an error, it means you don't yet have Node installed.
If the command doesn't report an active Node LTS version (e.g., v{version-node}), you don't have a suitable version of Node installed.

The best way to install Node is to use {uri-nvm}[nvm] (Node Version Manager).
If your package manager provides Node and npm packages, _and you're familiar with using the tools installed system-wide_, you may choose to go that route.
However, we believe you'll be more successful if you choose nvm.

NOTE: Most CI environments use nvm to manage the version of Node used in the build job.
By using nvm, you align your local setup with the environment used to generate and publish your production site.

If you're using Linux or macOS, follow {uri-nvm-install}[the nvm installation instructions] to set up nvm on your machine.
If you're using Windows, you can install the {uri-nvm-windows}[Windows port of nvm] via the {uri-choco}[Chocolatey package manager] using `choco install -y nvm`.
Alternatively, you can install the LTS release of Node directly using `choco install -y nodejs-lts`.

Once you've installed nvm, open a *new* terminal and install the latest Node LTS release using:

 $ nvm install --lts

IMPORTANT: If you're using nvm for Windows, you must enter the full version of Node when running commands (e.g., `nvm install {version-node}`, `nvm use {version-node}`).
Run `nvm list available` to see a list of available Node versions.

To make Node 10 the default in new terminals (Linux and macOS only), type:

 $ nvm alias default 10

Switch to this version of Node using the following command:

 $ nvm use 10

Now that you have Node installed, you can proceed with installing Antora.

=== Install Antora

To generate a site with Antora, you need the Antora CLI and an Antora site generator pipeline.
Once these packages are installed, you use the `antora` command to generate your site.

We'll begin by installing the Antora CLI using npm.
You should install this package globally so the `antora` command is always available on your PATH.

In your terminal, type:

 $ npm install -g @antora/cli

NOTE: If you prefer Yarn over npm, you can choose to install Antora using `yarn global add @antora/cli`.

Verify the `antora` command is available on your PATH by running:

 $ antora -v

If the installation worked, this command should complete successfully and report the version of the Antora CLI.

Next, install the default Antora site generator using npm (or Yarn):

 $ npm install -g @antora/site-generator-default

You can opt to install the site generator inside the project containing your playbook file instead of installing it globally.

Now that the Antora CLI and default site generator are installed, you are ready to set up a playbook and generate a documentation site.

=== Run Antora to Generate a Site

To generate a site with Antora, you need a playbook file that points to at least one content source repository and a UI bundle.
Since the Antora repository is set up as an Antora documentation project, we can use that for now as your content source.
Antora also provides a default UI for you to use out of the box.

==== Create a Playbook File

First, create a new directory for your site and switch to it.
Next, add a playbook file named [.path]_antora-playbook.yml_ and populate it with the following contents:

.antora-playbook.yml
[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: Antora Docs
content:
  sources:
  - url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora.git
    branches: master
    start_path: docs
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
----

Notice we're looking for a documentation component under the [.path]_docs/_ subdirectory of the master branch of the Antora git repository.
We're also using Antora's default UI as the UI for the site.
Antora will take care of assembling all this input together to produce a documentation site.

The UI bundle can be loaded from a URI or a local filesystem path.
If you want to use your own UI bundle, follow the instructions in the README for the https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/blob/master/README.adoc[Default UI].

==== Run Antora

To generate the site, simply point the `antora` command at your playbook file.

In your terminal, type:

 $ antora antora-playbook.yml

Antora will clone the content repository, convert the AsciiDoc pages to embeddable HTML, wrap the HTML in a page template from the UI, then assemble the pages together along with the assets into the destination folder, which defaults to [.path]_build/site_.

To view your site, navigate to any HTML page inside the destination folder in your browser.
Using this example, look for the entry point file [.path]_build/site/index.html_.
That file will redirect you to the start page.

==== Troubleshooting

If something goes wrong during generation, you'll see an error message in the terminal.
If this message does not provide enough information to fix the problem, you can ask Antora for more context.
To tell Antora to reveal the calls leading up to the error (i.e., the stacktrace), run the `antora` command again, this time with the `--stacktrace` option:

 $ antora --stacktrace antora-playbook.yml

Share this stacktrace when <<Getting Help,asking for help>>.

==== Using Private Repositories

If any of your content repositories require authentication, Antora will look up the credentials in the default git credential store file or one that you specify using the `--git-credentials-path` CLI option.
See the {uri-docs}/antora/latest/playbook/private-repository-auth[private repository authentication] documentation to learn more.

==== Changing Content

Antora also supports local content, which is essential for authoring.
If you want to make modifications to the documentation, you'll first need to clone the content repository (which in this example just happens to be the Antora repository):

 $ git clone https://gitlab.com/antora/antora.git workspace/antora

Next, update the content source entry in the playbook to point to the local checkout instead of the remote URL:

[source,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: ./workspace/antora
    branches: master
    start_path: docs
----

Now, any changes you make to the content under the [.path]_workspace/antora/docs/_ folder will be visible the next time you generate the site.

==== Running a Local Server (Optional)

A site generated by Antora is designed to be viewable with or without a web server.
However, you may need to view your site through a web server to test certain features, such as indexified URLs or caching.
You can use the serve package for this purpose.

Install the serve package globally using npm:

 $ npm i -g serve@6.5.8

That puts a command by the same name on your PATH.
Now launch the web server by pointing it at the location of the generated site:

 $ serve build/site

Paste the provided URL into the location bar of your browser and you'll be viewing your site through a local web server.
